# U.S.-Electric-Vehicle-Market-Share

In this project, I analyzed the U.S. electric vehicle market to understand the distribution and adoption rates of different vehicle types, Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs), and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

## EV % Distribution by State

This chart provides a general comparison of electric vehicle (EV) adoption across U.S. states. It displays the states with the highest and the lowest percentages of electric vehicles, allowing for a clear contrast between regions where EVs are more common and regions where they are still rarely used.

- **Top 5 States having highest EV %**
  - This part of the chart shows the states with the greatest adoption of electric vehicles. California leads by a wide margin, followed by the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Washington, and Nevada. These states generally benefit from strong environmental policies, financial incentives, higher fuel costs, and well-developed charging infrastructure, which encourage residents to choose electric vehicles.
- **Top 5 States having highest EV %**
    - This section highlights the states where electric vehicle usage is the lowest: South Dakota, Wyoming, West Virginia, Mississippi, and North Dakota. EV adoption in these states is very limited, mainly due to factors such as rural geography, longer travel distances, fewer charging stations, lower government incentives, and a higher reliance on traditional gasoline vehicles.

## Distribution of vehicle types by State

This stacked bar chart shows the distribution of vehicle types by state, expressed in percentages. For each U.S. state, the total bar equals 100% of vehicles, divided into four categories: PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles), HEV (hybrid electric vehicles), EV (fully electric vehicles), and gasoline vehicles.

- Gasoline vehicles still dominate in every state, while electrified vehicles (EVs, HEVs, and PHEVs) make up a smaller but varying share depending on the state. States such as the District of Columbia and California show higher proportions of electric and hybrid vehicles, reflecting stronger adoption of cleaner technologies. In contrast, many other states have larger gasoline shares and lower electrification, illustrating regional differences in infrastructure, policy, and consumer preferences.

## Distribution of alternative fuel use in the U.S.

-  Divided into three categories: Biodiesel, Ethanol, and Hydrogen

In the United States, ethanol is the most widely used alternative fuel, while biodiesel is used moderately and hydrogen is hardly used at all. This reflects the already established infrastructure for ethanol (such as the use of E85 in flex-fuel cars), while hydrogen still faces production and distribution challenges.

# Conclusion 

### Key insights

  - **EV market**: California and the District of Columbia are the clear frontrunners. States with strong EV adoption near ~2% include Washington, Hawaii, Colorado, New Jersey and a few others. The majority of states (≈40) have EV penetration at or below 1%, so most of the country remains early in the transition. Large states such as Texas and Florida have many EVs in absolute terms but low percentages relative to their huge vehicle populations.
  - **Alternative fuels**: Ethanol is the only alternative fuel with meaningful market presence; biodiesel is modest and hydrogen is essentially niche.

### Infrastructure Planning

- States with high EV share (CA, DC, WA, HI, CO, NJ) need continued expansion of fast chargers and grid upgrades to keep pace with adoption.
- Large, low-penetration states (TX, FL) are high-potential markets, these require proactive charging deployment now to avoid future bottlenecks. Moreover, they will see rapid percentage growth as adoption accelerates.
- Investment should balance where adoption is already high to avoid overload and where absolute EV counts are large but relative penetration is low to unlock growth.
